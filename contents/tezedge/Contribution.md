# Contribution Guidelines

TezEdge is a node shell for Tezos written in the Rust programming language. It is being developed as an open source project. We welcome all types of contributors who are interested in Rust and the TezEdge node, including programmers, documentation writers and testers. 

**What is Tezos?**

Tezos is decentralized ledger and smart contract platform built upon a self-amending blockchain. The unique selling point of Tezos is its governance model, which avoids forks by implementing a democratic process through which its users (stakeholders) vote on suggested changes to the blockchain. If successfully voted in, these changes are first implemented on the Tezos testnet. After they are proven to be safe, the Tezos blockchain is then updated. 

**Why should I contribute?**

This project is at the meeting point of two exciting technologies: the Tezos self-amending blockchain and the Rust programming language. Knowing how to work with either is a highly valuable skill in todayâ€™s global IT market, having an understanding of both will give you exponential value in this highly-competitive industry.

Additionally, there will be certain financial rewards (bounties) for all types of contributions, including markdown documentation, coding, bug discovery and more. 

**How can I contribute?**

To get a grasp of what our project is about, visit our GitHub repository where you can view the Tezos onboarding document as well as a readme file about our project. We will be expanding these sections as we progress. 

We do not require all contributors to be expert coders in Rust, but everyone who wishes to participate should first read the Readme.md for an introduction to our project and the Contribution.md (this document) to understand what assistance we are looking for.



*   **Coding**

If you are a developer or you just want to take a look at the code, you are welcome to download the latest version found on our repository. Please refer to our Coding Guidelines if you want to make a contribution. 

Everybody is welcome to fork this repo and change it as they wish. If you have an idea on how to improve the codebase, please do the following:



1. Create a fork of this repo
2. Change the code in your local fork
3. Send us a pull request

We regularly review pull requests and we will reward successful entries. 



*   **Documentation**

We welcome everyone who wants to contribute to the TezEdge documentation. Refer to our documentation to see what kind of writing style we utilize. If you have experience with markdown, you can start contributing right away. For those less familiar, we recommend using a [word doc to markdown](https://word2md.com/) converter.

All developer documentation is published on TezEdge developer website. The developer site is open source, and the code for building the site is located in this repository. 



*   **Testing**

Do you want to test? See the installation guide for the latest version of the TezEdge node on [our GitHub.](https://github.com/simplestaking/tezedge)

If you find any bugs and errors, please take screenshots and describe the issues that you are having.

**Practical information**

Before you begin:



*   Install the Rust compiler on your device. 

The easiest way to do this is through Rustup. You can find an installation guide on the [Rust GitHub.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs) Do not forget to set the nightly version of the compiler as the default, a detailed guide can be found [here.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#working-with-nightly-rust)

In order to compile OCaml source code, you will need to install one of these two items:



1. To compile the OCaml source code on a local device, you will need to install the latest version of OCaml. Detailed instructions can be found on the [Tezos GitLab.](https://tezos.gitlab.io/master/introduction/howtoget.html#build-from-sources)
2. To compile the OCaml source code in Docker, you will need to install the latest version of Docker. You can find the instructions at the [official Docker website.](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
